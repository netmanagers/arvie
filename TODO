* should postgresql create the database when it starts?
* we should be able to manage the flags to create database and related stuff better than just /arvados/flags/api_database_setup

* workbench & api pids should be placed somewhere else or cleaned properly on teardown
* compute and shell images should NOT use packages, as they're needlessly big
* prepare should properly setup nginx's geo.conf
